This is an ongoing project for Gear VR and Google Cardboard being developed in Unity. At the time of writing, you can navigate between a few spots at my family's farm in Illinois by clicking the various red circles scattered throughout the scene. There are also a few objects you can collect, including a key that allows you to enter the cabin.

The end goal is to create a platform for users to create their own levels, using photospheres they've taken themselves.

At the moment, this works on Android. iOS will be considered later down the road.
