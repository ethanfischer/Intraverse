This is an ongoing project for Gear VR and Google Cardboard being developed in Unity. At the time of writing, you can navigate between a few spots at my family's farm in Illinois by clicking the various red circles scattered throughout the scene. There are also a few objects you can collect, including a key that allows you to enter the cabin.

The end goal is to create a platform for users to create their own levels, using photospheres they've taken themselves.

At the moment, this works on Android. iOS will be considered later down the road.

You can see footage of it here:
